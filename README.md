# DetechedDocumentOpened
We will edit or create any document type like excel, word, pdf, or PowerPoint. We will add a 1x1 pixel image in it and set image's URL to our custom web API. And we will count opened or clicked document's total count and save it to the DB.

You can find Save 1*1 image to PowerPoint code from this gist..We used "GemBox.Presentation" library..
